                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Drones are becoming more common in the research field because drones can reach areas unreachable by people. Drones have been used to fly over historical buildings, glaciers, forestry, and volcanic eruptions. Ocean drones have mapped depths of the sea which for the most part was unexplored.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ConservationDrones.org is a community of researchers that have mapped hundreds of areas across Africa. They have discovered orangutan nest in the forest canopies, which is critical information for the fighting against poachers.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Agriculture researchers have used drones to monitor water usage in areas suffering from droughts in order to improve efficiency. The low altitude drones provide images that are more precise than satellites at a fraction of the price. 
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mark Ditmer, a biologist from University of Minnesota has begun researching the effects drones have on wildlife. Mark Ditmer started testing animals to see how much stress is inflicted on animals by the sight and sound of drones flying overhead. A different study concluded that three species of birds were not disturbed by the drones, the birds did not fly away when a drone hovered over them.

                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Although Amazon’s efforts to launch aerial delivery systems have delayed due to FAA regulations, they are not the only ones to fall under the FAA’s radar. Drones in the US are sanctioned for use for various military, research and recreational means. These such drones are not subject to the same amount of regulation as those in research and recreation.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; UAVs in the US are regulated up to 400 ft of airspace in populated areas. Commercial use of such drones have not been sanctioned by the FAA and are currently illegal. With concerns of air space and ground safety, the FAA is reluctant on providing licenses to commercial businesses to test any drone services within the United States. Due to this inability to research within the United State’s borders, Amazon has been forced to test out their technology in the United Kingdom.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On the other side of the spectrum, many fear of the possible safety concerns drones may bring.
                        For instance, there was a near collision in Fresno involving a drone and a SkyLife Helicopter in August 2015. The near collision happened about 1000ft. in the air.
                        <br>
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Along with the near collision, drones have been frequently used for criminal activity. The Border Patrol has recently said that Mexican cartels have used drones to bring illegal drugs across the border. Drones have been used in countries such as Russia, Australia, and the US to get contraband into prisons.
